EDA, or Exploratory Data Analysis can take many forms. This brief section will recommend a few packages which can be used to explore your data, more or less, automagically. The packages can be complex and may take some effort to learn. However, if you're brand new to data mining, you may benefit from reading these package documentation pages, and then applying their functions to your data.
