## Download R & RStudio

Remember. R and RStudio are not the same thing. It's a good idea to have up-to-date installations. As of this writing, the easiest way to find both applications for local download are from the post.co page

## Install R, RStudio, R packages

I recommend this Interactive [tutorial](https://tutorials.shinyapps.io/00-setup/ "how to install R, RStudio, and packages") for a nice interactive tutorial on installing R, RStudio, packages.

## Quarto installation

Quarto comes pre-installed with the latest versions of RStudio. However, if you want to install Quarto again, or for use with VSCode, learn how at [Quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/ "Get Started with Quarto")

## Install packages

Packages can be installed with the `install.packages()` function. Alternatively, from within RStudio \> Packages \> install

## Install Once!

You only have to install a package once and should avoid putting the `install.packages()` function in your scripts. Of course, you will need to update packages from time to time.

## Load packages

You should load packages at the top of your script. Then write your script. Then Run All

## Loading the tidyverse

![Tidyverse is a meta-package of several packages](images/package_tidyverse.jpg)

[Tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org "tidyverse") [@wickham2019] is a concept but also a package. More accurately it's a meta-package that loads about eight other packages. When you type `load(tidyverse)`, there's no need to also load `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `lubridate` or any of the packages that tidyverse loads. Redundantly, it's fine to write multiple load statements, but check the feedback from the code-chunk and you'll see what is being loaded by `load(tidyverse)`.
