## Data

All data are readily available for this workshop.

Whenever possible on-board datasets are used. This means you do not have to load any data, but you may have to load a library. For example the `starwars` dataset is part of the {dplyr} package. You may first have to load `library(dplyr)` to access the starwars data frame. Alternatively, you could access the data with the fully verbose *package::object* syntax: `dplyr::starwars`.

Some data sets are imported via the `read_csv` function. You an download the data and code from github (See GitHub icon; right-hand side of this webpage header), expand the zipped file. Then you'll find a data folder with the CSV files used in this workshop. Refer to the [import](import.html) page for tips on importing data.

## Code

You an download the data and code from github (See GitHub icon; right-hand side of this webpage header), expand the zipped file. Double click the Intro2R.Rproj file to launch all of the code directly into an RStudio project.
